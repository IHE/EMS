## EMS Overall workflow

The [EMS-Overall](http://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/EMS-Overall/branches/master/index.html) is a prototype IG that is intended to show how the EMS use-cases can leverage existing IHE profiles. This is not intended to restrict how the solution could be specified, but rather to show that existing infrastructure and existing content specifications that are readily implemented around the USA and elsewhere; are ready for the EMS community to use. This is not to trivialize getting connected, which does involve policy and systems design.
